# newton-server
Simple Flask app server to solve polynomial equations using Newton's method

## Getting started

Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) and [virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) if you haven't already. Then type:

```shell
./bootstrap.sh
```

You are now ready to run the `newton-server`

## Run the server

```shell
. env/bin/activate
python newton-server.py
```

## Solve a polynomial

The following request (performed with [httpie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie)) will request the solution for the equation: `-3xÂ²+2x+1 = 0` with initial choice of x = 0.

```shell
http -v POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/newton "coeffs":='[1,2,-3]' "x0":='0'
```

Here is the HTTP exchange:

```
POST /newton HTTP/1.1

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, compress

Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
    "coeffs": [
        1, 
        2, 
        -3
    ], 
    "x0": 0
}
```

```
HTTP/1.0 200 OK

Server: Werkzeug/0.10.1 Python/2.7.6

{"solution": -0.33333333333333343}
```

If the server could not find a solution, a 404 status code is returned.

```shell
http -v POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/newton "coeffs":='[1,2,3]' "x0":='0'
```

```

}
```

```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter problems while installing SciPy, you may be missing a few dependencies, like [BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/) and [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/). This will most likely happen if you are running Debian or Ubuntu. Try to install the dependencies with apt-get:

```shell
apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran
```

and run the `bootstrap.sh` script again.
